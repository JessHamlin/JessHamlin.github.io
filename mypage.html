        <h1>Hamlin, Jess</h1>
        <p>
          Three interesting facts: 
            Has lots of pets. 
            Loves chemistry. 
            No longer allowed in Loveland haunted houses. 
          Why am I studying Computer Science?
            Computer Science is involved in almost every field, and provides a lot of variety. 
            It also compliments chemistry well, and is constantly expanding. This appeals to me.
